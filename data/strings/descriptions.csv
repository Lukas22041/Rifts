dimensional_rift_interaction,CUSTOM,A tear in spacetime. ,,,,
rift_supermassive_blackhole1,PLANET,"A supermassive blackhole, larger than any blackhole ever observed within the sector. Despite its size, it gravitational forces seem to not exceed that of a blackhole within our sector.

It's accretion disc shines in a beautiful orange color.

rifts_dune,SHIP,"The Dune-Class is a light frigate designed by the Chirality. It Exceeds in terms of speed, making it a good fill in for any fleet that requires ships that distract from the heavier targets.
Those Aspects are only amplified through its ""Temporal Shell"" Shipsystem, allowing it to quickly send out light-fire and retreat.",,,,
rifts_opera,SHIP,"The Opera-Class is a heavy frigate designed by the Chirality. The Opera-Class manages to unload as many missiles as a destroyer, without loosing the speed of a Frigate. While not as fast as the Dune-Class, its unlikely that its targets can escape from it.",,,,
